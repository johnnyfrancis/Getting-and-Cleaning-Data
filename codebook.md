### Codebook

## Subject & activity

The subject and activity variables relate to the unique subject and activity pair for each measurement as follows:

- subject: Unique integer subject ID
- label: The labeled activity for each measurement. This is one of: 
    - WALKING
    - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    - SITTING
    - STANDING
    - LAYING
